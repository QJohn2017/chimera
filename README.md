Quasi-Cylindrical Pseudo-Spectral Analytical Time Domain Particle-In-Cell code for plasma and FEL simulations

The installation requires recent NumPy, SciPy and Fortran compiler with openMP support (gcc or intel)

To perform 'make' one will need to build a FFTW3 (http://www.fftw.org) and point to this in a Makefile
